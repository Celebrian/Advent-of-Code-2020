# Advent-of-Code-2020
Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.
I am trying to solve these in C++.

The program is tested with the example given in the task like so:
```
cat dayXX/testinput.txt | dayXX/dayXX | diff - dayXX/testoutput.txt
```
This means the program can be tested on actual input, like so:
```
cat dayXX/input.txt | dayXX/dayXX | diff - dayXX/output.txt
```
